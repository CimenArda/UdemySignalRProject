# Order Management System for Restaurants

In this project, I used Api in the backend. I consumed this Api structure that we use in the backend on the UI side. I used a very powerful interface in Consume operations.
I sent an e-mail to our users for the reservation process. I performed transactions such as instant notification, instant messaging, and instant cart with SignalR. I coded our project using clean code principles, adhering to the architecture and solid principles as much as possible.
